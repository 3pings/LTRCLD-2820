    We hope this lab was beneficial to you! It took months of detailed oriented work to complete this lab. While
    we can't cover all the topics of ACI integration of Kubernetes, we believe that these four hours you
    have picked to spend with us it have been valuable to you.

    The web based lab guide is available to you from anywhere on the internet. You can share it with
    colleagues and friends.
